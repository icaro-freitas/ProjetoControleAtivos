# ProjetoControleAtivos
This prototype was developed to create a system to help manage assets for businesses or institutions.<br> <br>
Using the ESP32 microcontroller for data processing and connection with a graphical interface that stores asset data in a database, 
RFID technology was used to identify assets by reading tags with sensors.<br> <br> <br>

The hardware was built in a simulated environment with two RFID readers, that simulated two different rooms and the rotation of the assets.<br><br>

The system was also created to establish the connection and allow the manipulation of the rooms, assets, and system configurations.<br><br>


This project had the function of connecting the development of hardware and software, besides creating a simulation of an industrial project that put together students of industrial engineering 
and computer engineering.<br> 
The project was useful in order to emulate a business development environment, both engineering domains were successfully integrated in this manner.<br>
